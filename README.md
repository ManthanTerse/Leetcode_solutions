# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions in Python 🐍

This repository contains my solutions to **LeetCode problems** in Python.  
I am learning **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** step by step.  
Topics I have covered are Sorting , Binary Search ....

| 704 | Binary Search       | Easy       | The problem asks us to find the index of a given target in a sorted array. Since the array is sorted, the first thought is to use Binary Search, which is more efficient than a linear scan. Search target in a sorted array using O(logn).|
| 344 | Reverse String      | Easy       | The idea is to swap characters from both ends of the string, moving toward the center. By placing pointers at the start and end, we can efficiently reverse the string in-place without needing extra space.Time complexity: O(n).|
| 088 | Merge Sorted Array  | Easy       | The problem requires merging two sorted arrays into one sorted array. The simplest approach is to first copy all elements from nums2 into the empty space at the end of nums1, then sort the entire array. This leverages Python's built-in sorting rather than manually merging. |
